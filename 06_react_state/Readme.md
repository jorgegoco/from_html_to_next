# Understanding State and Hooks in React

## 1. Introduction to Hooks

React introduces a set of functions known as `hooks`. Hooks are a powerful feature that allow you to add additional logic, such as state, to your functional components.

## 2. The Concept of State

In the context of React, `state` refers to any information in your User Interface (UI) that changes over time. These changes are usually triggered by user interactions.

## 3. The Role of Hooks in Managing State

Hooks provide a way to "hook into" React's state management features and lifecycle methods directly from functional components. This allows you to manage state and other React features without writing a class component.
