# Transitioning from HTML to JavaScript, then to React, and finally to Next.js

## Transitioning from HTML to JavaScript

1. **User's Web Page Visit**: When a user visits a web page, the server responds by returning an HTML file to the user's browser.

2. **Construction of Document Object Model (DOM)**: The browser constructs the DOM, an object-oriented representation of the web page.

3. **Understanding DOM**: The DOM acts as an interface between your JavaScript code and the user interface.

4. **Manipulating DOM with JavaScript**: JavaScript can listen to user events and manipulate the DOM in response.

5. **Difference Between HTML and DOM**: While HTML provides the initial content and structure of the web page, the DOM represents the current state of the web page after any changes have been made by JavaScript code.

## Transitioning from JavaScript to React

1. **Imperative Programming with JavaScript**: Updating the DOM directly with JavaScript is an example of imperative programming.

2. **Simplifying DOM Manipulation**: Libraries like React.js can simplify this process by providing higher-level abstractions to manipulate the DOM.

3. **Introduction to React**: React is a declarative library that helps developers build user interfaces.

4. **Integrating React into Your Project**: To use React in your project, you load two scripts from an external website: `react` (the core React library) and `react-dom` (provides DOM-specific methods).

5. **Rendering with ReactDOM**: Instead of directly manipulating the DOM with plain JavaScript, you use the `ReactDOM.render()` method from `react-dom` to instruct React what to render.

6. **Understanding JSX**: React uses JSX, a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to describe your UI in a familiar HTML-like syntax.

7. **Transforming JSX with Babel**: To make your JSX code understandable by browsers, you’ll need a JavaScript compiler, such as Babel, to transform your JSX code into regular JavaScript.

## Migrating from React to Next.js

1. **Create a React app**: Start with a basic React application.

2. **Delete unnecessary scripts**: The react and react-dom scripts since you’ve installed them with npm. The Babel script because Next.js has a compiler that transforms JSX into valid JavaScript browsers can understand.

3. **Install Next.js, React, and ReactDOM**: Use npm to install these packages locally:

   ```
   npm install next react react-dom
   ```

   This will add the latest versions of Next.js, React, and ReactDOM to your project.

4. **Update scripts in package.json**: Change the scripts in your `package.json` to use Next.js:

   ```json
   "scripts": {
       "dev": "next dev"
   }
   ```

   You can now start the development server by running `npm run dev` in your terminal.

5. **index.html file**:

- Remove the `<html>` and `<body>` tags because Next.js will create these for you.
- The code that interacts with app element and ReactDom.render() method.
- The `<script type="text/jsx">` tag.

  The only code left in the HTML file is JSX, so you can change the file type from .html to .js or .jsx.

6. **Create a pages directory**: In Next.js, each page is associated with a route based on its file name. So create a new directory called `pages` and move your `index.js` (or `index.jsx`) file into it. Add default export to your main React component to help Next.js distinguish which component to render as the main component of this page.

7. **Test your application**: Run your application locally to make sure everything works. You can do this by running `npm run dev` and navigating to `localhost:3000` in your browser.
