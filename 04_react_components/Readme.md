# Understanding React Components

## 1. Components as Functions

In React, components are essentially functions. They are JavaScript functions that return User Interface (UI) elements.

## 2. Writing JSX in Components

Inside the return statement of the function, you can write JSX. JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like syntax in your JavaScript code.

## 3. Naming Conventions for React Components

React components should be capitalized. This convention helps distinguish them from plain HTML tags and JavaScript functions.

## 4. Using React Components

You use React components the same way youâ€™d use regular HTML tags, by enclosing them within angle brackets (`<>`). For example, if you have a component named `MyComponent`, you would use it in JSX like this: `<MyComponent />`.

## 5. Nesting React Components

Applications usually include more content than a single component. You can nest React components inside each other, similar to how you would nest regular HTML elements. This allows you to build complex UIs from smaller, reusable pieces.
